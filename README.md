# qcm-bot
This was a Discord bot that I made during this year's finals to help everyone study. It picks questions from a "database" of previous exams and serves them as a fresh quiz, it then gives people their score on the quiz and the list of their errors and the right answers they missed.
As this was my first attempt at doing something useful for people and I was in the rush of the exams, the code isn't very well fleshed out but it does work.

I don't plan on updating this bot but I keep it around I will reuse that idea in a more efficient way in few months.
